 This project demonstrates Sring JMS usage.

 Building

    - Run on the console under template-spring-jms\ folder the next command:
        
                mvn clean compile
        
 Running
 
        - Run on the first console under template-spring-jms\ folder the next command:
        
                mvn activemq:run
        
        - Run on the second console under template-spring-jms\receiver\ folder the next command:
        
                mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.stepbysteptopro.template.receiver.Receiver
                
          You should get the message:    
                
                Receiver is running...
                
          It means the listener has been run. The listener will listen the messages from queue. 
          The LoveLetterReceiverServiceImpl service will handle the messages.
          
          
        - Run on the third console under template-spring-jms\sender\ folder the next command:
          
                mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.stepbysteptopro.template.sender.Sender
          
          After that on the second console (receiver's console) you will see the message: 
          
                ======= Love letter ===========
